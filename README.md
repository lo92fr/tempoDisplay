# tempoDisplay
An esphome script to display information about tempo day color
This is a WIP project, used since several week at home, but still need improvement.

Tempo information is retrieve from rte service, so you will neeed to create an account, and get an api token.
Consumption information is retrieve from emoncms service, and will currently only work if you have it.
The service will certainly failed bad if it can access emoncms instance, and feed value and address are currenlty hardcode in the source.
